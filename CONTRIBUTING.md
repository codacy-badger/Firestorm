# Contributing

## In Development

Firestorm is currently in pre-release stage. Until a stable v1.0 is released, the core APIs are subject to change rapidly.

I ask politely that, until then, pull requests are avoided.


## Issues & Features

Discussion is encouraged. Feel free to submit issues to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/connellw/Firestorm).


## Coding Standards

When developing Firestorm, please follow the coding style present in the project already.

A more comprehensive standards document will be written one day.
